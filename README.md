# TrapTheCat

This program allows the user to play the game "Trap the Cat" (https://trap-thecat.com/) in most Python IDEs using Pygame.

The goal is for the user to trap the cat by clicking the tiles on the screen. The user wins if the cat is trapped in a single tile. The cat wins if it is able to escape the grid.

The user and the cat take turns making moves. The user chooses one tile to block the cat with, and the cat chooses a direction to move in. The cat can move in any direction, including diagonally.
